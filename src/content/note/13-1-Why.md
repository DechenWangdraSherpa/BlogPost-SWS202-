# Why Active Directory?

Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft’s directory service used in Windows network environments. It provides a centralized way to manage users, groups, computers, policies, and other resources across an organization. AD works as a distributed, hierarchical structure that supports authentication and authorization in Windows domains.

AD is very powerful, but it comes with serious security challenges. Many of its features are not "secure by default" due to its backward compatibility. As a result, AD is often misconfigured, and attackers can exploit these flaws to move through the network (laterally) or escalate their privileges (vertically).

Even a regular user with no special permissions can read most of the data in AD. This is because AD is a large read-only database where most objects can be viewed by any domain user. Attackers often begin by compromising a low-privilege user and then use that access to explore the domain for vulnerabilities.

This makes securing AD extremely important. Organizations must apply defense-in-depth strategies such as least privilege, segmentation, and hardening. The noPac attack from 2021 is one example where attackers exploited weak AD configurations to gain full control over a domain.

AD is also very scalable — it supports millions of objects and can grow as organizations expand. This makes it both useful and dangerous: it simplifies access and management for admins, but also gives attackers a huge attack surface.

# Why AD Matters in Security

Approximately 95% of Fortune 500 companies use Active Directory. That means almost every large network a security professional tests will include it. If an attacker gets access to AD (even as a regular user), they can begin enumerating the network and searching for attack paths.

Understanding how AD works is essential for both offensive (pentesting) and defensive (blue team) roles. Attackers use AD to move deeper into networks. Defenders must understand AD’s structure to detect and stop them.

Ransomware operators, including the Conti group, have used AD flaws like PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527) and Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472) to spread through networks. These attacks often start with a simple domain user and end with full domain control.

To detect and prevent such attacks, security professionals need deep knowledge of AD. Tools exist to help with enumeration and exploitation, but they’re only effective when used by someone who understands AD’s internals.

# Brief History of Active Directory

AD is built on LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), which dates back to the 1970s. Before AD, companies used X.500-based directory services like Novell Directory Services (1993).

Microsoft first tried to build directory services in Windows NT 3.0 (1990s). These early attempts evolved into what became Active Directory. The first beta of AD appeared in 1997, and it was officially released with Windows Server 2000.

Over time, Microsoft added new features to AD. In Server 2003, they introduced “Forests,” which let organizations group separate domains under one structure. Server 2008 introduced Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), which allows single sign-on (SSO) across different systems and organizations.

ADFS uses claims-based access control, where a user is identified by a set of claims packed into a security token. This lets users access different systems securely with one set of credentials.

# Modern Changes to AD

Windows Server 2016 brought important security improvements to AD. It introduced Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA), which are more secure ways to run services and scheduled tasks. gMSAs help protect against attacks like Kerberoasting.

Server 2016 also pushed AD toward the cloud. Microsoft released Azure AD Connect to link on-prem AD with Office 365 and enable single sign-on in cloud/hybrid environments.

Despite these improvements, AD is still prone to misconfigurations. Vulnerabilities are regularly discovered — not just in AD, but also in systems that integrate with it (like Exchange).

Because of this, defenders must stay on top of patching and configuration best practices. Penetration testers must be ready to find misconfigurations before attackers do.

# Why You Need to Understand AD

Active Directory is complex. One small change can create serious security gaps. You need a strong understanding of AD structure, protocols (like LDAP and Kerberos), permission models, and common misconfigurations.

Even as more companies adopt cloud and hybrid models, on-premise AD is still everywhere. If you're doing network pentesting, you will almost always encounter it.

Knowing how AD works will help you find vulnerabilities, advise on remediations, and confidently test environments of any size — from 20 hosts to 10,000.
