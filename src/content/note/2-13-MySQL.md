# MySQL

## Overview:
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed and supported by Oracle. It is widely used for managing databases in web applications and other services, providing a structured way to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently.

### Key Features:
- **Client-Server Model**: MySQL operates based on the client-server principle, where the server manages the database, and clients interact with it.
- **SQL Language**: The database uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data.
- **Data Storage**: Data is stored in tables within databases. Each table has rows (records) and columns (attributes).
- **High Performance**: MySQL is optimized for high-speed data processing and efficient use of storage space.

## MySQL Clients:
MySQL clients are software applications that interact with the MySQL server to perform database operations. Clients can send SQL queries to:
- **Insert** new data.
- **Delete** data.
- **Modify** data.
- **Retrieve** data.

### Example Use Case: WordPress
WordPress uses MySQL to store its content, such as posts, user details, and site settings. It can be accessed via localhost, but in larger systems, it might be distributed across multiple servers.

## MySQL Databases:
MySQL is commonly used in applications such as dynamic websites, where fast response times are required. It is often part of the **LAMP** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack or **LEMP** (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP).

### Types of Data Stored:
- **Text Data**: Titles, content, meta tags.
- **User Information**: Email addresses, usernames, passwords.
- **Links**: External or internal links to files.
- **Sensitive Data**: Passwords (usually encrypted before storage).

## MySQL Commands:
SQL queries are used to interact with MySQL databases:
- **Display Data**: `SELECT`
- **Modify Data**: `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`
- **Modify Structure**: `ALTER`, `CREATE`, `DROP`
- **Manage Users**: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`
- **Create Relationships**: `JOIN`

MySQL is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, which can expose sensitive data if not properly secured.

## MariaDB:
MariaDB is a **fork** of MySQL, created by the original MySQL developers after MySQL was acquired by Oracle. It is an open-source RDBMS that is fully compatible with MySQL but offers additional features and improvements.

## Default Configuration:
Misconfigurations in MySQL can lead to security vulnerabilities. The default settings are sometimes insecure, and administrators should review the configuration to ensure proper security.

### Key Security Settings:
- **user**: Specifies the MySQL user that the service runs as.
- **password**: The password for the MySQL user.
- **admin_address**: The IP address used for administrative access.
- **debug**: Controls debug settings, which may leak sensitive information.
- **sql_warnings**: Determines whether warnings are generated during INSERT statements.
- **secure_file_priv**: Limits the scope of file import/export operations.

### Dangerous Settings:
- **Plaintext Passwords**: Configuration files often contain passwords in plaintext, posing a security risk if accessed by unauthorized users.
- **Verbose Error Messages**: Debug and SQL warnings can provide sensitive information that could be exploited.
- **Remote Access**: MySQL servers often run on **TCP port 3306** and are accessible externally, which is a security risk if not properly configured.

## Footprinting MySQL Service:
MySQL servers should generally not be accessible from external networks, but sometimes they are left open due to misconfiguration. Attackers can scan port 3306 (the default MySQL port) using tools like **Nmap** to identify vulnerable servers.

### Security Best Practices:
- **Disable Remote Access**: Limit MySQL access to local or trusted networks.
- **Strong Passwords**: Ensure MySQL user passwords are strong and not stored in plaintext.
- **Review Configuration Files**: Make sure sensitive data is not exposed through misconfigured settings.
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing detailed error messages to end users, as they can reveal sensitive information.
